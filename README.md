# Custom Scroll Display

This project is designed to track and display the user's scroll progress on the page. It comprises the following functionalities:

Scroll Tracking: Calculates and displays the user's scroll progress as a horizontal progress bar at the top of the page.

Data Fetching: Utilizes the fetch API to retrieve data from the specified URL. This data is stored in the component's state and displayed on the page to create a scroll length larger than the viewport.

Loading and Error Handling: Manages loading states and error messages to provide user feedback during the data fetching process.

Dynamic Rendering: Conditionally renders a list of items if data is successfully fetched, or displays loading and error messages as appropriate.
